    <h1>The Carabao and the Shell</h1>
    <h3>By Mabel Cook Cole</h3>
    <p>
      One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a
      shell and they began talking together.
    </p>
    <p>“You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell.</p>
    <p>“Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.”</p>
    <p>“Then let us try and see,” said the carabao.</p>
    <p>
      So they went out on the bank and started to run. After the carabao had
      gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!” Then the
      carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran
      on.
    </p>
    <p>By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!”</p>
    <p>Again another shell answered, “Here I am!”</p>
    <p>
      The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he
      ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered
      him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran
      until he dropped dead.
